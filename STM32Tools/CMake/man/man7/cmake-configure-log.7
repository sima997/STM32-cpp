.TH "CMAKE-CONFIGURE-LOG" "7" "Aug 05, 2025" "4.1.0" "CMake"
.SH NAME
cmake-configure-log \- CMake Configure Log
.sp
Added in version 3.26.

.SH INTRODUCTION
.sp
CMake writes a running log, known as the \fIconfigure log\fP,
of certain events that occur during the Configure step.
The configure log does \fInot\fP contain a log of all output, errors,
or messages printed while configuring a project.  It is a log of
detailed information about specific events, such as toolchain inspection
by \fI\%try_compile()\fP, meant for use in debugging the configuration
of a build tree.
.sp
For human use, this version of CMake writes the configure log to the file:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/CMakeFiles/CMakeConfigureLog.yaml
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
However, the \fIlocation and name of the log file may change\fP in future
versions of CMake.  Tools that read the configure log should get its
location using a \fI\%configureLog\fP query to
the \fI\%cmake\-file\-api(7)\fP\&.
See the \fI\%Log Versioning\fP section below for details.
.SH LOG STRUCTURE
.sp
The configure log is designed to be both machine\- and human\-readable.
.sp
The log file is a YAML document stream containing zero or more YAML
documents separated by document markers.  Each document begins
with a \fB\-\-\-\fP document marker line, contains a single YAML mapping
that logs events from one CMake \(dqconfigure\(dq step, and, if the configure
step finished normally, ends with a \fB\&...\fP document marker line:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
\-\-\-
events:
  \-
    kind: \(dqtry_compile\-v1\(dq
    # (other fields omitted)
  \-
    kind: \(dqtry_compile\-v1\(dq
    # (other fields omitted)
\&...
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
A new document is appended to the log every time CMake configures
the build tree and logs new events.
.sp
The keys of each document root mapping are:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBevents\fP
A YAML block sequence of nodes corresponding to events logged during
one CMake \(dqconfigure\(dq step.  Each event is a YAML node containing one
of the \fI\%Event Kinds\fP documented below.
.UNINDENT
.SS Log Versioning
.sp
Each of the \fI\%Event Kinds\fP is versioned independently.  The set of
keys an event\(aqs log entry provides is specific to its major version.
When an event is logged, the latest version of its event kind that is
known to the running version of CMake is always written to the log.
.sp
Tools reading the configure log must ignore event kinds and versions
they do not understand:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
A future version of CMake may introduce a new event kind or version.
.IP \(bu 2
If an existing build tree is re\-configured with a different version of
CMake, the log may contain different versions of the same event kind.
.IP \(bu 2
If \fI\%cmake\-file\-api(7)\fP queries request one or more
\fI\%configureLog\fP object versions,
the log may contain multiple entries for the same event, each
with a different version of its event kind.
.UNINDENT
.sp
IDEs should write a \fI\%cmake\-file\-api(7)\fP query requesting a
specific \fI\%configureLog\fP object version,
before running CMake, and then read the configure log only as described
by the file\-api reply.
.SS Text Block Encoding
.sp
In order to make the log human\-readable, text blocks are always
represented using YAML literal block scalars (\fB|\fP).
Since literal block scalars do not support escaping, backslashes
and non\-printable characters are encoded at the application layer:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\e\e\fP encodes a backslash.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\exXX\fP encodes a byte using two hexadecimal digits, \fBXX\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.SH EVENT KINDS
.sp
Every event kind is represented by a YAML mapping of the form:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
kind: \(dq<kind>\-v<major>\(dq
backtrace:
  \- \(dq<file>:<line> (<function>)\(dq

.TP
.B \fBbacktrace\fP
